** Using

** Why
   I was writing an IRC in racket and i kept getting annoyed with
   the APIs i was having to use and issues i kept running into 
   with regards to having multiple servers, easy parsing of events, 
   and whatnot. So I wrote the original implementation in rircc, along
   with curses library stuff. 

   I then Realised that I wanted some extra features and I got annoyed 
   hacking on other irc libraries, so I ended up just writing my own.
